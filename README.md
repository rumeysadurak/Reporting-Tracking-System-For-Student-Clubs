# Reporting-Tracking-System-For-Student-Clubs
It is a web project that we developed as a group with four other college friends. A website that allows tracking and reporting of sales made by club members for the benefit of the club. The project was developed in visual studio with #C language, .Net framework, MVC design pattern and MSSQL database.
